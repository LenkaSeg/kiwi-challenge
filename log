As your entry task, we'd like you to provide us with a built and working 
Docker image.
You can share your code with us via repo. BONUS: multiple logical 
commits are preferable to just one.
Requirements

- A simple html site, with the title "I want to attend the Kiwi.com 
Weekend in the Cloud"
  - A simple site will be enough, but feel free to get creative.
- Use Nginx as your web server
  - BONUS: use SSL
  - Hint: use Let's Encrypt
  - https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/
- Use Docker Hub to build and share your image
